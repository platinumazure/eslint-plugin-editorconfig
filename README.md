ESLint plugin which generates some core ESLint rules' configuration based on
a repository's `.editorconfig` file.

## Supported properties (mapped to ESLint rule)

|`.editorconfig` [properties](https://editorconfig.org/#supported-properties)|ESLint rule|ESLint options
|--------------------------|-----------|-----|
|`indent_style` and `indent_size`|[`indent`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/indent)|"tab" or number
|`end_of_line`|[`linebreak-style`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/linebreak-style)|"unix"\|"windows"
|`trim_trailing_whitespace`|[`no-trailing-spaces`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-trailing-spaces)|Not used
|`insert_final_newline`|[`eol-last`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/eol-last)|"always"\|"never"
|`max_line_length`|[`max-len`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-len)|Number option only

## Unused properties:

These [properties](https://editorconfig.org/#supported-properties) are unused:

- `tab_width`
- `charset`
- `root`

## Available Configurations

You can extend from this configuration to generate an ESLint configuration that
matches your `.editorconfig` file.

For more details on how to extend your configuration from one or both of these plugin configurations, please see the [ESLint plugin configuration documentation](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#using-the-configuration-from-a-plugin).

### auto

This configuration will look for an `.editorconfig` file in your current working
directory or its ancestors and generate an ESLint configuration from the
properties in that file.

You can use this configuration by extending from `"plugin:editorconfig/auto"` in your configuration file.

## Semantic Versioning Policy

Like ESLint itself, this ESLint plugin follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). However, due to the nature of ESLint as a code quality tool, it's not always clear when a minor or major version bump occurs. To help clarify this for everyone, we've defined the following semantic versioning policy, based on the policy used by ESLint:

* Patch release (intended not to break your lint build)
    * Backward-compatible bug fixes around how ESLint configuration is generated.
    * Improvements to documentation.
    * Non-user-facing changes such as refactoring code; adding, deleting, or modifying tests; and increasing test coverage.
    * Re-releasing after a failed release (i.e., after having published a release that doesn't work for anyone).
* Minor release (might break your lint build)
    * A new rule is supported in config generation.
    * A new plugin configuration is created.
* Major release (likely to break your lint build)
    * A backward-incompatible change is made to the generation of ESLint configuration.
